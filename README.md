# ♟️ Viyugam 64

**Viyugam 64** is an AI-powered Chess Automation system that **predicts and plays the next best move** directly on your computer’s chessboard screen using deep learning.  
It combines **Computer Vision + Deep Learning + Automation** to observe the board, predict the best move, and execute it using mouse control — just like a real player.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Board Recognition** – CNN-based model predicts the board’s current FEN state from a screenshot.  
- 🧠 **Move Prediction** – Deep network predicts the best legal chess move.  
- 🖱️ **Auto Move Execution** – Automatically moves the piece on screen using `pyautogui`.  
- 🪟 **Overlay Region Selection** – Simple `tkinter` window for board capture region setup.  
- 💻 **Multi-device Support** – Runs seamlessly on **MPS (Apple Silicon)**, **CUDA (NVIDIA GPU)**, or **CPU**.  
- 🔁 **Live Looping Mode** – Continuously predicts and plays until stopped (ESC key).

## 🧩 Model Architecture

### 1️⃣ Board Recognition Model (`ChessCNN`)
Predicts the 8×8 board matrix from a screenshot image.

- Input: Grayscale 64×64 chessboard image  
- Output: 13×8×8 tensor (12 pieces + empty square channel)  
- Core Layers:
  - 4 convolutional layers  
  - ReLU activations  
  - Adaptive average pooling to (8×8)

### 2️⃣ Move Prediction Model (`ChessImproved`)
Takes the board tensor + color flag and predicts the best move.

- Input: (14×8×8) tensor  
- Output: 1792 move logits  
- Architecture:
  - Convolutional + BatchNorm blocks  
  - AdaptiveAvgPool2d  
  - Fully-connected layers → Dropout → Output

## 🧠 Dataset Format

- **Board images**: Captured screenshots of live chess games.  
- **FEN labels**: Represent board states.  
- **Move labels**: Indexed UCI moves (`a2a4`, `b1c3`, etc.).  
- **`label.npy`**: Contains all possible move mappings.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bharath-shanmugasundaram/Viyugam-64.git
cd Viyugam-64
````

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Example requirements:**

```text
torch
torchvision
numpy
pillow
mss
pyautogui
python-chess
tk
pynput
pyfiglet
```

## 📦 Model Files

Make sure these are present inside the `model_files/` directory:

```
model_files/
 ├── board_model_state.pth
 ├── move_model_state.pth
 └── label.npy
```

---

## 🧭 How It Works

1. The program captures your chessboard screen region using `mss`.
2. The **Board Model** predicts the board’s FEN structure.
3. The **Move Model** predicts the next best move.
4. It validates the move against legal moves using `python-chess`.
5. The move is executed via `pyautogui` mouse control.

---

## ▶️ Usage

### 1️⃣ Set Board Region

Optionally, run this function to manually resize the capture window:

```python
create_resize_overlay()
```

Press **SPACE** once aligned.

### 2️⃣ Run Prediction

At the bottom of the script:

```python
region = (32, 228, 692, 693)
time.sleep(5)
run_live_loop(region, color_flag=1)
```

* `color_flag = 1` → You play **White**
* `color_flag = 0` → You play **Black**

Press **ESC** anytime to stop the loop.

## 🧾 Output Example

```
Using device: mps
Predicted move: e2e4
Predicted move: d7d5
Predicted move: g1f3
...
```

---

## 🖼️ Debugging

To debug the captured board image:

```bash
debug_last_board.png
```

This file saves the most recent captured board frame.
